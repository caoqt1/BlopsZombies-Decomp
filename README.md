# BlopsZombies-Decomp
An attempt at decompiling Call of Duty: Black Ops â€“ Zombies

# What we know so far.
The game is made with the Marmalade SDK, I've tried using certain bms scripts and have managed to open some files, but I can't actually get into the meat of the game.

If anyone knows what they are doing, feel free to help out.
